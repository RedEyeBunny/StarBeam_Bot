Telegram bot for website automation

The project uses selenium to control the website (https://webkiosk.juet.ac.in/) and get data for the user.

I choose telegram as the platform as it is a bot friendly platform and eases using the website for the user.

Please suggest any changes that you would like to see in the bot.
